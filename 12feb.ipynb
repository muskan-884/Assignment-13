    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "# In Python, an exception is a runtime error that occurs when a program is executed and something goes wrong. An exception is an object that represents an error or unexpected condition that has occurred during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter encounters invalid syntax in the code. These errors occur when the code is parsed by the Python interpreter and are usually easy to fix, as they can be spotted simply by looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are caught by the interpreter at compile time, while exceptions are caught at runtime. Syntax errors usually result from a mistake in the code, such as a missing colon or incorrect indentation, while exceptions usually result from a mistake in the program logic or from unexpected input or system conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When an exception occurs during the execution of a Python program, the interpreter raises an exception object, which can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms like try-except blocks. By catching and handling exceptions, a program can gracefully recover from errors and continue executing, rather than crashing or exiting abruptly.\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
